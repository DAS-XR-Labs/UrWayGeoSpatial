        you start at a higher elevation and have less overall climbing to do to reach
        the summit, and you\u2019ll clear the treeline on an obvious, well-marked
        trail (it\u2019s one of a few on this list you\u2019ll actually find on a
        map). As the trail begins switchbacking up the hill from the highway, look

      description: "With two largely separate approaches to the summit, Twin Peaks
        is probably one of the most attainable trails in Ouray, but that doesn\u2019t
        deter from the solitude you'll find here.  Gaining all of its 1200 feet of
        elevation in less than 0.7 miles, the old trail is the shortest and most
        direct route. In the mid-80s, a devastating rockslide tore through the mountainside,
        wiping this trail out. After nearly two decades, and only through extensive
        trail work, the route was re-opened in 2004. Now, more than ten years later,
        the trail is still holding up, thanks to 607 feet of cribbing put in place
        to stabilize it. Knowing the fact that the route never strays from this unstable
        talus slope, real caution should be taken. This trail is truly an undertaking,
        but it\u2019s the most rewarding of the two options up Twin Peaks. Do heed
        the \"steep and dangerous\" warnings posted at the onset."

        arguably the best bird's-eye view in town. Giving wide berth to Oak Creek,
        this roundabout route up Twin Peaks takes advantage of easier grades than
        the more direct, but more lung-busting Old Twin Peaks Trail. Dropping about
        eighty feet to cross Oak Creek at one point, the worst of it comes with a
        500 foot climb to its intersection with the old trail.

        you can easily modify this route by adding any of the nearby trails as well.

        and the shortest approach. The rock is a type of sandstone, something like
        that of Eldorado Canyon but blonde in color. That said, don''t go expecting
        Eldorado Canyon like climbing. In some areas, the bands of sandstone are
        separated by bands of shale (choss). '
